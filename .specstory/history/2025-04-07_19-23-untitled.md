I need the times in the circle.so events to be reflected in the cards of this wordpress plugin in CST format.

Okay, I can help with that. To start, I need to find the code responsible for displaying the event times in the cards.

Okay, I've found the relevant template files where the event times are displayed:

1.  `templates/events-list.php` (for the list view)
2.  `templates/events-calendar.php` (for the calendar/grid view)
3.  `templates/events-widget.php` (for the widget view)

All three files use the WordPress `date_i18n()` function along with `strtotime()` to display the time based on the site's configured timezone.

I'll now modify these files to convert the event times to CST before displaying them. I'll use the 'America/Chicago' timezone identifier, which correctly handles both Central Standard Time (CST) and Central Daylight Time (CDT).

First, I'll edit `templates/events-list.php`.
