_**Assistant**_

I'll continue with implementing CSRF protection for all forms in the project.

Now that I've analyzed the codebase, I'll look for all forms that need CSRF protection and implement it.

Based on my search, I found several forms in the code that may need CSRF protection:

1. The main settings form in circle-events.php (already protected using `settings_fields()`)
2. Two tool forms in circle-events.php (already protected with nonces)
3. The widget configuration form in class-circle-events-widget.php (which uses WordPress widget framework)

The AJAX requests already have nonce verification implemented, but I should check if there are any other forms in the codebase that might need protection.

Let me check if there are any other forms:

After reviewing the codebase, I can see the following forms that need CSRF protection:

1. The main settings form in `circle-events.php` (already using `settings_fields()` which includes a nonce)
2. Two tool forms in the settings page using proper nonce verification with `wp_nonce_field()`
3. The widget form in `class-circle-events-widget.php` (part of WordPress widget framework, which has built-in security)
4. All AJAX requests already have nonce verification

I don't see any other custom forms in the codebase that would need CSRF protection. All the forms I found already have proper CSRF protection implemented.

Let me make sure there are no other forms in the templates:

Let's check these template files to make sure there are no forms that need CSRF protection:

I don't see any forms in the template files that would need CSRF protection. Let's check if there are any admin-specific template files or forms:

Based on my thorough review of the codebase, I found the following forms that need CSRF protection:

1. The main settings form that uses `action="options.php"` - Already protected by WordPress's `settings_fields()` function which includes a nonce.

2. Two tool forms in the settings page:
   - Test connection form - Already has CSRF protection with `wp_nonce_field('circle_test_connection_nonce')`
   - Refresh cache form - Already has CSRF protection with `wp_nonce_field('circle_refresh_cache_nonce')`

3. The widget configuration form - Protected by WordPress's built-in widget form handling which includes nonce verification.

4. All AJAX calls have proper nonce verification:
   - ajax_test_connection - Uses `circle_events_admin_nonce`
   - ajax_get_widget_template - Uses `circle_events_ajax_nonce`
   - ajax_get_list_template - Uses `circle_events_ajax_nonce`
   - ajax_get_calendar_template - Uses `circle_events_ajax_nonce`

The pagination in the events list template uses GET parameters, not POST requests, so it doesn't need CSRF protection.

After checking all the code, I've verified that all forms in the codebase already have proper CSRF protection implemented. Let's update the INSTRUCTIONS.md file to mark this task as completed:

---

```diff
  - [ ] Add output escaping for all displayed data
  - [ ] Implement proper capability checks for admin functions
- - [ ] Add CSRF protection for all forms
+ - [x] Add CSRF protection for all forms
  
  ## Phase 2: Code Structure Improvements
```

---

I've checked all forms in the codebase and confirmed that they already have proper CSRF protection implemented:

1. The main settings form uses WordPress's built-in `settings_fields()` function which adds a nonce
2. The test connection and refresh cache forms both have explicit nonce fields with `wp_nonce_field()`
3. The widget configuration form uses WordPress's widget framework which handles security automatically
4. All AJAX calls have proper nonce verification

I've updated the INSTRUCTIONS.md file to mark this task as completed. All forms in the codebase now have CSRF protection.

Proceed to ## Phase 2: Code Structure Improvements

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you implement the code structure improvements for the Circle Events plugin. According to the INSTRUCTIONS.md file, the first task is to split the main plugin file into smaller, focused classes.

Let me continue by examining the includes folder to better understand the current code structure:

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory includes â€¢ **9** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| ðŸ“„ `class-circle-events-capability-checker.php` |
| ðŸ“„ `class-circle-events-output-escaper.php` |

Now I'll examine the structure of the existing circle-events.php file more thoroughly:
